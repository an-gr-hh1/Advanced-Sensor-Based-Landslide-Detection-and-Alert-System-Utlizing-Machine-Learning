# Advanced-Sensor-Based-Landslide-Detection-and-Alert-System-Utlizing-Machine-Learning
This is a B.Tech final year project on Landslide Detection using IoT and ML. LightGBM, maps out high-risk areas and IoT nodes send real-time updates to cloud. All  sensed data are presented on an  android dashboard and features an interactive map and trigger an alert when abnormalities  are detected.
