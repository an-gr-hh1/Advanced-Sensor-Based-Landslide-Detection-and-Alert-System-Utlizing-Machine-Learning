# Advanced-Sensor-Based-Landslide-Detection-and-Alert-System-Utlizing-Machine-Learning
 In this proposed system, we present a precise and timely warning system to reduce the effects of landslides. This system strategically partitions its ML and IoT components, improving both risk prediction and simultaneous supervision. The predictive model LightGBM, is trained with an extensive dataset obtained from DEM, which enabled mapping out high-risk areas with great accuracy. The system utilizes IoT nodes dedicated entirely to areas of high risk pinpointed by the ML model, consisting of a rain sensor, a soil moisture sensor, an ADXL 345 sensor, and a GPS module that sends real-time updates to a centralized cloud framework. All real-time sensed data are processed and demonstrated on an android dashboard and features an interactive map that shows hazard zones, allowing swift action and emergency response. It has been programmed to trigger an alert when abnormalities are detected. The combination of machine learning and the IoT allows for increased accuracy of prediction and responsiveness, making it a strong and scalable solution to protect people in regions prone to landslides. The proposed system significantlyimproves the efficiency of technology in disaster management.
